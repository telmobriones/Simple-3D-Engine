# Simple-3D-Engine
This project is a basic 3D engine that uses scene graph data structures and the OpenGL pipeline. It includes a number of features such as frustum culling, bump mapping, specular mapping, cube mapping and multitexturing. The engine also supports different types of lights (local, directional, and spotlight) that are calculated using the Blinnâ€“Phong reflection model, as well as lighting provided by the Cook-Torrance BRDF microfacet model. All of these features are implemented as shaders in the shader folder.

# How to run it

1) You need the following packages for installing this:
- freeglut3-dev
- libglew-dev

The following command would do in on an Ubuntu system:

% sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libglew-dev

2) Build the project using CMAKE

Run this *only once*

% cmake CMakeLists.txt

Then, build tha project with:

% make

3) Run the project:

% ./browser

4) Sometimes you have to uncomment this line in Browser/browser.c (around line
   446):

  // Uncomment following line if you have problems initiating GLEW
  //
-  // glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
+  glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
